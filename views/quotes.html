<p>"Lord Gilbert, Baron of England by the grace of his majesty, King Henry II, seized upon the person of a priest of the Holy Church and unlawfully did hold him in custody. Furthermore, in the presence of Lord Gilbert, and by his command, his men seized upon this priest when he tried to escape and put him to death. This is the sin of murder and sacrilege. In that Lord Gilbert has rendered no act of contrition or repentance, and is at the moment, at liberty in the land, we do, here and now, separate him from the precious body and blood of Christ, and from the society of all Christians. We exclude him from our Holy Mother Church and all her sacraments, in heaven, or on Earth. We declare him excommunicate and anathema. We cast him into the outer darkness. We judge him damned with the devil and his fallen angels and all the reprobate, to eternal fire and everlasting pain!"<br/><span id="credits">-Becket(1964)<span></p>
<p>"And when I was at Findhorn I met this extraordinary English tree expert who had devoted himself to saving trees, and heâ€™d just got back from Washington lobbying to save the Redwoods. And he was eighty-four years old, and he always travels with a backpack because he never knows where heâ€™s going to be tomorrow. And when I met him at Findhorn he said to me, â€œWhere are you from?â€� And I said, â€œNew York.â€� And he said, â€œAh, New York, yes, thatâ€™s a very interesting place. Do you know a lot of New Yorkers who keep talking about the fact that they want to leave, but never do?â€� And I said, â€œOh, yes.â€� And he said, â€œWhy do you think they donâ€™t leave?â€� And I gave him different banal theories. And he said, â€œOh, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s that way at all.â€� He said, â€œI think that New York is the new model for the new concentration camp, where the camp has been built by the inmates themselves, and the inmates are the guards, and they have this pride in this thing that theyâ€™ve builtâ€”theyâ€™ve built their own prisonâ€”and so they exist in a state of schizophrenia where they are both guards and prisoners. And as a result they no longer haveâ€”having been lobotomizedâ€”the capacity to leave the prison theyâ€™ve made or even to see it as a prison.â€� And then he went into his pocket, and he took out a seed for a tree, and he said, â€œThis is a pine tree.â€� And he put it in my hand. And he said, â€œEscape before itâ€™s too late."<br/><span id="credits">-My Dinner With AndrÃ©<span></p>
